This is my first p5js project. It's a puzzle game about rotating the cells on triangular grid. Featuring in-game level editor.

Challenges faced:
- Set up the triagular grid system.
- Build an in-game level editor which gives serialized level data.
- Gameplay: shuffle the board, implant player action, undo option, and check solve.
- Apply flawless animation between moves.
